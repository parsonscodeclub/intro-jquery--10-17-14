      <h1>This is the title of this post.</h1>
      <h2>it even has a subtitle</h2>
      <p>Each of us in our own lives needs to do what we can to help the poor. These challenges are not all of government's making. I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine. And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad. The Palestinian Authority must develop its capacity to govern, with institutions that serve the needs of its people.

      <p>If there's a senior citizen somewhere who can't pay for their prescription drugs, and has to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer, even if it's not my grandparent. It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well. Indeed, we can recall the words of Thomas Jefferson, who said: "I hope that our wisdom will grow with our power, and teach us that the less we use our power the greater it will be." America does not presume to know what is best for everyone, just as we would not presume to pick the outcome of a peaceful election. Trade can bring new wealth and opportunities, but also huge disruptions and changing communities. All of us share this world for but a brief moment in time.</p>
      <p>I have unequivocally prohibited the use of torture by the United States, and I have ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed by early next year. The issues that I have described will not be easy to address.</p>
      <p>He was a good-looking kid, six two, six three, clear eyed, with an easy smile. Clearly, the past 50 years have not weakened your resolve as faithful witnesses of the gospel. Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less. They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values.</p>
      <p>I learned that everyone's got a sacred story when you take the time to listen. The man I met more than twenty years ago is a man who helped introduce me to my Christian faith, a man who spoke to me about our obligations to love one another; to care for the sick and lift up the poor. Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans. The dream of opportunity for all people has not come true for everyone in America, but its promise exists for all who come to our shores - that includes nearly seven million American Muslims in our country today who enjoy incomes and education that are higher than average. This tolerance is essential for religion to thrive, but it is being challenged in many different ways.</p>
